Requirements & Specifications

Our website is about a dog adoption organisation. 
Bringing into discussion the layout problem , we are going to create several pages , such as : Home page ,which will describe mostly
the purpose of our website and a suitable , convincing design.
Another page will be the one sharing with the future dog owners some of our previous work with dogs and ,also , the successful adoptions 
we managed to undertake. Moreover , we will present a separate page with the dogs to be adopted . For each dog , we are going to attach
a picture , which , when clicked on , will pop up a window with the full description of the respective dog.
This window will also have a button for accepting an adoption that will send the customer directly to an appointment formular.
This formular is sent afterwards into a database , which lets the customer know if the adoption for that dog is still available. 
On the top of the page ,there are going to be placed the Sign in and Sign up  buttons . The sign up will create a new account for the
customer , while the sign in button will only ask for credentials.
Also , on the top of the page , a search button will be placed , which gives you the filter of searching by breed.

In order to accomplish everything, we thought we use PHP , for managing the coummunication between the website and the database ,
Oracle for creating and managing the database , JavaScript , for example , for creating those on-click pop-ups. Also , we are going to use 
HTML and CSS for design and layout.
